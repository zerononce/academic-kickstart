Welcome to the 'news' portal for the 'hashfail' brand. Staying in line with our core principle of providing open, honest & helpful resources / information for all individuals in the blockchain space - this specific facet of the hashfail brand is designed to provide information for users that are looking for unbiased coverage of 'current events' in the blockchain space. 

**What Does Non-Bias Coverage Mean?**  

It means that we are not: 

* Being paid by **_any of the entities that we are covering_** 
* There are **_zero advertisements on this website_** 
* The content is all free 
* The author(s) of any given content on this site are **_not invested_** in any of the technology/companies/entities being discussed in **_any article_** 
* No VC firm/'incubator'/major company/hedge fund/or otherwise has invested into the existence of this entity - thus, we have zero conflicts of interest 

**If You're Not Profiting From This, Have No Investors, and Are Not Placing Advertisements on This Site - What's in it For You?** 

A common phrase you'll see in a lot of opsec communities is, "If you don't know what the product is, then **_you_** are probably the product." 

This statement, in most cases is **_completely accurate_**. 

However, it is not the case here. 

**So Why Are You Doing This, Then?**

For a few reasons, which are: 

1. Blockchain **_is legitimate technology_**. It does have the power to bring about the advances in human achievement, ability, censorship resistance, ownership, and freedom that proponents have touted for years since Bitcoin's inception in 2009. However, over the past few years, the blockchain space has **_widely failed_** to live up to this promise of placing the legitimate goal of improving this technology over financial/ulterior motives. Thus, this brand was created to establish a sense of 'equilibrium' balance out the greed & corruption in the blockchain space. 
2. There is a noticeable absence of thorough, in-depth coverage of various events, concepts, entities, and relationships in this space. This has created a vacuum in the blockchain space where scammers/criminals/bad actors are able to exploit this ignorance for their own gain. The end result is that the space is harmed as these frauds continue to proliferate over time, since those in the mainstream that see such cases of rampant criminality use it to bolster their confirmation bias about Bitcoin/blockchain being fraudulent. Our goal is to help mitigate this cycle of fraud and ignorance by publishing as much comprehensive information and intelligence as we can. 
3. On a personal level, this is what we are passionate about - spreading knowledge. In a world where the internet is increasingly becoming the battlefield of choice for entities ranging from high schoolers to nation states, it is more important now than eve rbefore to ensure that we begin arming ourselves with as much education as possible. Specifically, blockchain & digital currencies, in general, are complex financial and technological tools that require a certain threshold of understanding for users to safely use in a beneficial manner. Thus, another one of our goals is to ensure that we can facilitate this goal too.
